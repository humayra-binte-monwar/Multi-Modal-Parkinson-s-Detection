# Multi-Modal-Parkinson-s-Detection
Parkinson’s disease often leads to distinct changes in speech, gait, and handwriting, affecting voice clarity, walking stability, and fine motor skills. This project investigates each of these key modalities by extracting relevant features and applying both machine learning and deep learning techniques to classify Parkinson’s disease. For speech, the analysis includes acoustic features and spectrogram-based models; for gait, temporal and variability features are derived from ground reaction force data; and for handwriting, spatial and kinematic characteristics are examined. The results from each modality are then combined using a late fusion approach, which integrates the prediction probabilities to enhance overall detection accuracy. This multi-modal strategy aims to provide a more comprehensive and reliable method for identifying Parkinson’s disease.
