# Multi-Modal-Parkinson-s-Detection
Parkinson’s disease noticeably affects speech, gait, and handwriting, leading to changes in voice quality, walking patterns, and fine motor control. This project analyzes all three modalities using machine learning and deep learning methods, and combines their results through late fusion to improve the accuracy of Parkinson’s disease detection.
